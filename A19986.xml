         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:9952:21"/> men, and was found in ſhape as a man. Hee humbled himſelfe, and became obedient vnto the death, even the death of the Croſſe.</hi> And therefore himſelfe of himſelfe, Pſ. 40.8, <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>

                  <p>Howbeit here, Beloued, wee are to knowe that the name of a <hi>Servant</hi> in holy Scripture is taken after diverſe and ſundry ſorts. Every <hi>faithfull Perſon</hi> being bought and redeemed from the bondage of Sinne, &amp; Sathan, to ſerue and obey God in righteouſneſſe, and true holines, is there a Servant, as Rom. 6.22. and Luk. 1.74. <hi>Secondly,</hi> one that ſerueth, and obeyeth God, not onely in the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of godlineſſe, but in ſome particular function, and calling, is there a Servant too. So Paul, and Iames, Tit. 1.1 and Iames, 1.1. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> one whom God doth vſe as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, &amp; meanes, to effect and performe his wil in the work of ſome particular mercy, or ſome particular iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is there a Servant alſo. Nay every Creature of God obeying his will, is called there the Servant of God, and therefore the Prophet David: <hi>Al,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are thy Serva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,</hi> Pſal. 119.91. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> was a <hi>Servant</hi> here in the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> ſenſe, and meaning, and his particular Function was, in that hee executed as a Mediatour the will of God in working Mans redemption, &amp; therefore himſelfe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe (as I told you before) <note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 20.28.</note> 
                     <hi>The Sonne of man came not to be ſerved, but to ſerue, and to giue his life for the ranſome of many.</hi> And thus much of the ſecond point, that the Sonne of God came downe from heaven to rid vs from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and wofull eſtate wherein we were. Come we now vnto the third point, namely the meanes our Saviour vſed to that effect and purpoſe. The Meanes I told you was his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> and that compriſed in theſe words: <hi>Hee hath borne
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9952:21"/> and caried: he was plagued, ſmitten, humbled, wounded, and broken: Chaſtiſement, and Stripes. Surely hee hath borne our Infirmities, and carried our Sorrowes, yet wee did iudge him as plagued and ſmitten of God, and humbled, but he was wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for our tranſgreſſions, hee was broken for our Iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, &amp; with his ſtripes we are healed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When I ſay the Meanes our Saviour vſed was his <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> I meane not ſo his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> as if all his <note n="p" place="margin">

                     <hi>Life</hi> beſides had beene impertinent to that purpoſe, for he was made our <hi>Redemption,</hi> through the whole courſe of his <hi>Life,</hi> and what ever hee did was ſomewhat towards the effect of that <hi>Redemption.</hi> But the holy Scripture attributing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly our Redemption to his <hi>Death,</hi> becauſe that Death of his was the very chiefeſt, and the greateſt worke of all, hence it is I obſerue his <hi>Paſſion</hi> to be the very true Meanes indeed. Concerning which his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> ſince the foure Evangeliſts ſo ſufficiently record it in their Writings, &amp; whatſoever they record is oftentimes read vnto you, I ſhall not neede to rehearſe the particulars as being well knowne (I hope) to every of you, only ſomewhat ſhall I ſay of his DEATH, as the very vpſhot of all the reſt.

As <hi>firſt</hi> and formoſt in the <hi>foure firſt</hi> Chapters, concerning the Schiſmes that were among them: in the <hi>Fift,</hi> concerning the inceſtuous Perſon: in the <hi>Sixt,</hi> concerning their quarrels: in the <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,</hi> concerning Queſtions about Mariage and Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: in the <hi>Eight,</hi> concerning things that were offered vnto Idols: in the <hi>Ninth,</hi> concerning the weake Brethren: in the <hi>Tenth,</hi> concerning Puniſhments that befel the Iſraelites for ſinne, and might in time befall themſelues too: in the <hi>Eleventh,</hi> concerning their behaviour in their publike Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and Congregations, and Adminiſtration of the Sacraments: in the <hi>Twelfe, Thirteenth,</hi> and <hi>Foureteenth,</hi> concerning Spirituall Gifts: he commeth in this <hi>Fifteenth</hi> Chapter (from whence the words of my Text are take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) to the grand Queſtion of all, concerning the <hi>Reſurrection of the Dead,</hi> which vntil he commeth vnto my Text, he ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> and formoſt, he makes a Preamble, and that in the firſt, and ſecond Verſes. <hi>Secondly</hi> he proues by many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the Reſurrection of the dead: two of them before my Text, foure, come after. The <hi>Firſt</hi> he proues it by, is by the example of our Saviour, and it is in this Chapter from the third verſe to the eighteenth, and it is in effect thus much: <hi>If there be no Reſurrection of the dead, then was Chriſt not raiſed from the dead: but Chriſt is raiſed from the dead, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is there a Reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> reaſon is in the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Verſe, &amp; the Summe of it is this: <hi>If ſo bee Chriſtians in this life only, doe hope in Chriſt, then are they of all men the moſt miſerable: but Chriſtians are not miſerable, much leſſe of all men the moſt miſerable, therefore in this life onely, they hope not in Chriſt,</hi> and conſequently they are to riſe againe from the dead, that they may bee partakers of that Hope concerning the Life that is to come.</p>
                  <p>Being thus farre on his way, he turnes a little aſide to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:9952:33"/> the better confirming of that which hee had deliuered a little before. Hee had delivered a little before, namely in the ſixteenth verſe (and it was part of the firſt Reaſon hee had made) that if ſo bee there were no Reſurrection of the dead, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Chriſt was not raiſed at all. He now aſſumes that Chriſt is raiſed, and it is the whole ſcope of this my Text, &amp; whereof I ſhall God willing entreat at this time, <hi>But now is Chriſt riſen from the dead, and was made the firſt fruits of them that ſlept, for ſince by man came death, by man came alſo the Reſurrection of the dead.</hi>

                     <hi>Neceſſity</hi> in common ſpeech is vſually taken many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of waies. There is a <hi>Neceſſity</hi> by way of <hi>commodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> when it is expedient, &amp; convenient, that wee vſe the helpe of an other thing. Thus having a iourney to make, an <hi>Horſe,</hi> or a <hi>Coach</hi> is neceſſary, that is, it is more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to vſe them, then to vſe them not. There is a <hi>Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> by way of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iolence,</hi> that compels a thing out of his place to his proper place againe. Thus a <hi>Stone</hi> when it is caſt on high, muſt needs fall downe againe, no remedie. There is thirdly a <hi>Neceſſity Abſolute,</hi> that cannot: poſſibly be otherwiſe then it is. Thus <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> are abſolutely neceſſary. Laſtly, there is an <hi>Abſolute Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> by way of <hi>Conſequence,</hi> I meane when we cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly attaine vnto a thing, without the helpe of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing: and this is the Neceſſity I meane in this place, a <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of ſuch <hi>Conſequence,</hi> as vnleſſe we doe thus, or thus, vnleſſe we do ſo, or ſo, we cannot poſſibly be ſaved. Now that <hi>Feeding</hi> on our Saviours <hi>Fleſh,</hi> &amp; <hi>Drinking</hi> his <hi>Bloud</hi> is thus neceſſary, is notified here vnto vs two maner of waies. <hi>Firſt,</hi> by our Saviours Proteſtation, <hi>Verely, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, I ſay vnto you: Secondly,</hi> vpon paine of eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>Except yee eate the Fleſh of the Sonne of man, and

                  </p>
                  <p>The words <hi>Verely, verely,</hi> in the Originall, are <hi>Amen, Amen,</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> is a word that hath his fourth in everie <note n="f" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>I, but ſome will ſay, ſeeing this <hi>Eating</hi> our Saviours <hi>Fleſh,</hi> &amp; <hi>Drinking</hi> our Saviours <hi>Bloud</hi> may be done by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of vs <hi>Spiritually</hi> in this ſort, what need we doe it then by the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> ſeeing we may without it <hi>Eate Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> and we eate but <hi>Spiritually</hi> with it? Beloued, the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not what in this reſpect we <hi>may,</hi> but what we <hi>must</hi> performe: and things ſtanding as they doe, what it is that now in this caſe God requireth at our hands. The time was, <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was not, &amp; there was no vſe of it at all: from <hi>Adam</hi> vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> none were circumciſed: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit after the Lord had made it a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and proteſted that the <hi>vncircumciſed Man-child</hi> ſhould be <note n="z" place="margin">Gen. 17.14</note> cut of from

There was, <note n="a" place="margin">1.

Then ſaid he vnto him, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt not obeyed the voice of the Lord, behold, as ſoone as thou art departed from me, a Lion ſhall ſlay thee.</hi> So when he was departed from him, a Lion found him, and ſlew him. If <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe had like to haue beene ſlaine, and another was ſlaine in very deed for not obeying the voice of the Lord in a matter hee might haue ſeemed to haue ſome Scripture on his ſide, <hi>Touch not mine Annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and doe my Prophets no harme,</hi> Pſ. 105.15: how doth it behooue vs to repaire to theſe <hi>Elements,</hi> ſeeing the Lord himſelfe hath ſo commaunded vs, and not to diſpute as <note n="b" place="margin">2.

Firſt, the <hi>Meat</hi> ment here, that it is <hi>Bread,</hi> witneſſe the Wordes of our Saviour himſelfe, who when in the ſeaven and twenteth verſe hee had ſaid vnto them, <hi>Labour not for the Meat which periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but for the Meat that endureth vnto everlaſting life, which the Sonne of Man ſhall giue vnto you,</hi> diſcourſeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards of <hi>Bread</hi> only, &amp; how that <hi>Bread</hi> was his <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and how <hi>Himſelfe</hi> was that <hi>Bread.</hi> The <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> The <hi>liuing Bread</hi> which came downe from heaven, and giueth Life vnto the world: ſo incomparably beyond <hi>Manna,</hi> as <hi>Manna</hi> was beyond it ſelfe, when as it was <hi>Angels Food,</hi> Pſ. 78.26, and when it <hi>ſtuncke, &amp; was full of wormes,</hi> Exod. 16.20. Now how our Saviours <hi>Fleſh</hi> is <hi>Meat,</hi> and his <hi>Bloud, Drinke;</hi> and his <hi>Fleſh</hi> is <hi>Meate</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and his <hi>Bloud, Drinke</hi> indeed, wee ſhall the better vnderſtand, if ſo be we call to mind the ſeverall <hi>Properties</hi> that <hi>Bread</hi> hath (the Meat here vnderſtood) and the great Preheminence that this <hi>Bread</hi> hath, aboue all other Bread whatſoever.</p>

                     <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>Properties</hi> of <hi>Bread,</hi> is to ſtrengthen mans heart, as ſpeakes the Prophet David, Pſ. 104.15, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophet Eſay, hee <note n="b" place="margin">Eſay. 3,1.</note> calls it <hi>The Stay of Bread:</hi> the Prophet <note n="c" place="margin">Ezech. 4.16</note> Ezechiel <hi>The Staffe of Bread.</hi> Indeed were it not for <hi>Bread,</hi> it would be woe with Mankind, we being able no more to want that peculiar kind of Food, then any one thing elſe whatſoever. This it was that made Sathan pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume ſo much vpon our Saviour after his <hi>Faſt</hi> of fortie daies, for he little doubted but at that time, he would haue done much for a morſell of Bread.

                  <p>What it was that was ſpoken to <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made vnto him here intimated, was made mention of before, Gen. 12.2. <hi>Get thee out of thy Country,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and from thy kinred, and from thy Fathers houſe, vnto the Land that I will ſhew thee, and I will make of thee a great Nation, and will bleſſe thee, and make thy Name great, and thou ſhalt be a Bleſſing.</hi> This Promiſe was renewed, Gen. 13.14, <hi>Lift vp thine Eies now,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and looke from the place where thou art Northward, and Southward, and East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and West-ward. For all the Land which thou ſeeſt will I giue vnto thee, and to thy ſeed for ever. And I will make thy Seed as the Duſt of the Earth, ſo that if a man can num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Duſt of the Earth, then ſhall thy ſeed be numbred.</hi> The Promiſe was made the third time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.4. where when <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſaid to the Lord: <hi>O Lord God what wilt thou giue me, ſeeing I goe Childleſſe, and lo a Servant of my houſe ſhall be mine Heyre: This man</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>ſhall not bee thine Heyre, but one that ſhall come out of thine own Bowels, he ſhalbe thine Heyre.

And he ſaid vnto him, ſo ſhall thy Seed be.</hi> It was made alſo the Fourth time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.18. It was made the Fift time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.4. It was made the Sixt time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.10. It was made the Seaventh time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18, where the Lord ſpeaking to Abraham, <hi>And in thy Seed</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall all the Nations of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> Now for an excellent Commentary of all theſe Places, eſpecially of this Laſt, we haue a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Paſſage of the Apoſtle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  <p>What? &amp; were all theſe Promiſes to <hi>Abraham</hi> alone? No doubtleſſe, no more then once it was meant to <hi>Adam</hi> alone, when as it was ſaid vnto him, <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eate bread,</hi> Gen. 3.19. <hi>Abraham</hi> here, as he was in this place the <hi>Father</hi> of the <hi>Faithfull,</hi> ſo hee ſuſtained their Perſons to, and therefore what was ſaid to him, was ſaid alſo to all ſuch Parents as would follow the Steps of faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Bringing vp of their Children. Like as ſpeakes the Apoſtle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 4.12, how hee was the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> not vnto them only which are of the Circumciſion, but vnto them alſo that walke in the Steps of the Faith of our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> which he had when he was vncircumciſed.

                     <hi>I will not leaue thee, nor forſake thee:</hi> but was it to be interpreted of <hi>Ioſhua</hi> alone?

                  <p>And thus, Beloved, haue you ſeene effected, what I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed at the firſt. <hi>You</hi> haue heard of the Authority which God, and Nature, haue given vnto Parents over their Children, in the Bringing of them vp. <hi>You</hi> haue heard of the Duty that Children owe, and ought to perfourme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Parents. <hi>You</hi> haue heard of the Bleſſing that doth enſue vpon Parents therevpon. And what, Beloved, ſhall I now ſay? The Application is ſoone made: Be you to your Children ſuch <hi>Parents</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and you ſhall not want ſuch <hi>Bleſſings</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> had. Now that you may endeavour to bee ſuch, I will commend vnto you two Points, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that you remember with your ſelues who it is that hath made you Fathers of Children: <hi>Secondly,</hi> why and wherefore he hath made you ſuch.</p>
                  <p>If we thinke that to bee a <hi>Father</hi> is a neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the <hi>Marriage Bed,</hi> a thouſand Inſtances in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Age may be yeelded to the contrary. Even <hi>Abraham</hi> here, of whom we haue ſpoken ſo much, after he had been marryed a long ſeaſon, how was he <hi>Childleſſe</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. You heard euen now what he ſayd: <hi>O Lord God</hi>

I for my part am perſwaded that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Syllable he vttered, had annexed therewith a Floud of Teares. What? <hi>Abraham</hi> Childleſſe, who had receaued ſo many ſeverall Bleſſings from the hand of God before? <hi>Abraham,</hi> who had otherwiſe the World at will, Rich in Cattell, in Silver, and in Gold, nay very Rich, Gen. 13.2? <hi>Abraham, who had built an Altar,</hi> &amp; called on the Name
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:9952:112"/> of the Lord, Gen. 12.8? <hi>Abraham</hi> Childleſſe? when as <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 10.6.</note>

He that goeth to a Iudge, goeth to him that is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Iuſtice, &amp; that ſits in the roome of God to do right. For the ſeat of Iustice is the ſeate of God. If there were, no Law to be miniſtred, but every man might doe what hee would, and reckon all his owne, whatſoever he could get, or come by, what a Life would it be? How ſhould any man be Maſter of that he hath? who can imagine what Iniuries, Cruelties, Murthers and Streames of Bloud would follow? Thanks be to God, who in mercy hath given vs a Law, and Iuſtice to guid vs by. Let vs bee content to ſeeke helpe at this Law without wrath, or malice.

As every Man thinks it lawfull to vſe his owne, or to require his owne: ſo let every man bee contented to leaue that hee holdeth, when LAW ſaith it is none of his. The Law is no Breach of Charitie, it is the Bond, and Knot to keepe Men in loue. A Sonne, may attempt Law with his Father, yet doe it in ſuch dutie, as becommeth a Sonne. A Subiect may attempt Law even with his Prince, and yet loue &amp; reverence his Prince as it becommeth a Subiect.
